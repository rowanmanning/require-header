## Requirements

This library requires the following to run:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+


## Usage

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
npm install allow-methods
```

Load the library into your code with a `require` call:

```js
const { requireHeader } = require('require-header');
```

`requireHeader` will return a middleware function that will error if the request does not set the given header. The error will have `message` and `status` properties which you can use.

It accepts two arguments. Firstly, the name of a header which is required:

```js
requireHeader('User-Agent');
```

Secondly (optionally) a message which will be used in the error if the request message does not match:

```js
requireHeader('User-Agent', 'User-Agent header is required');
```

### Route-level

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Only requests with a User-Agent header will continue
app.get(requireHeader('User-Agent'), () => { ... });
```

If you want to do something useful with the error, for example output a sensible JSON response, you will need to define an error handler for your application (*after* the route definition):

```js
app.use((error, request, response, next) => {
    response.status(error.status || 500).send({
        message: error.message
    });
});
```

### Application-level

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Require a User-Agent header across the entire application
app.use(requireHeader('User-Agent'));
```
